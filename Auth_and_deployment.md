### Student Handout: User Authentication and Deploying Flask Applications

Welcome to this session on User Authentication and Deploying Flask Applications. This handout
provides a concise overview of the key concepts and examples to help you understand and
apply these skills in your web development projects.

### **Part 1: User Authentication in Flask**

#### What is Authentication?

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user trying to access a web
application. It ensures that only authorized users can access certain parts of the website.

#### Why is Authentication Important?

Authentication is crucial for protecting sensitive information and ensuring that only authorized users can access personal data.

### 1. **Setting Up User Registration and Login Forms in Flask**

1. **User Registration Form:** Collects user information like username, email, and password. The data is sent to the server and stored in a database.

```python
    from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
    from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
    def register():
    if request.method == 'POST':
    username = request.form['username']
    password = request.form['password']
    hashed_password = generate_password_hash(password)
    # Save the username and hashed password to the database
    return redirect(url_for('login'))
    return render_template('register.html')
```

2. **Login Form:** Asks for the userâ€™s username and password. The server checks if the credentials match the database.


```python
    @app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
    def login():
    user = User.query.filter_by(username=request.form['username']).first()
    if user and check_password_hash(user.password, request.form['password']):
    login_user(user)
    return redirect(url_for('dashboard'))
    return 'Invalid credentials'
```

3. **Securing Routes with Login-Required Decorators:** Restrict access to certain parts of the website to logged-in users.

```python
    from flask_login import login_required

    @app.route('/dashboard')
    @login_required
    def dashboard():
    return "Welcome to your dashboard!"

```

### 2. **Password Hashing and Security Best Practices**

- **Password Hashing:** Use hashing to store passwords securely. This prevents exposure of plain text passwords if the database is compromised.

```python
    from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash check_password_hash

    # Hashing a password
    hashed_password = generate_password_hash('mysecretpassword')

    # Checking a password
    check_password_hash(hashed_password, 'mysecretpassword') # Returns True if the password matches
```

### 3. **Introduction to Flask-Login for Session Management**

- **Session Management:** Manage user sessions to keep track of logged-in users.

```python
    from flask_login import LoginManager, login_user, logout_user,
    login_required

    login_manager = LoginManager()
    login_manager.init_app(app)

    @login_manager.user_loader
    def load_user(user_id):
    return User.get(user_id)

    @app.route('/logout')
    @login_required
    def logout():
    logout_user()
    return redirect(url_for('login'))
```

### **Part 2: Deploying Flask Applications**

Deployment is the process of making your Flask app available on the internet by hosting it on a server.

### Hosting Options

1. **Heroku:** A cloud platform that simplifies deploying web applications with a free tier.
2. **DigitalOcean:** Provides more control over your server, suitable for more advanced users.
3. **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** Offers a wide range of services for deploying applications, suitable for large-scale projects.

### Setting Up a Production Environment

- **Gunicorn:** A Python web server for running Flask apps.
- **Nginx:** A web server that handles incoming requests and forwards them to Gunicorn.

### Managing Environment Variables and Secrets

- Use environment variables to store sensitive information like database credentials and API keys securely.

```python
    import os

    DATABASE_URL = os.getenv('DATABASE_URL')
    SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
```

### **Conclusion**

In this session, we covered:

1. **User Authentication:** Setting up user registration and login forms, securing routes, and
using password hashing for security. We also introduced Flask-Login for session
management.
2. **Deploying Flask Applications:** The process of deploying a Flask app, exploring hosting
options, setting up a production environment, and managing environment variables.

These skills are essential for building secure and accessible web applications. Practice implementing these concepts in your projects to gain proficiency.
